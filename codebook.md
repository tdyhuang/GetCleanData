- the original data set was " Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" which was collected byDavide
Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz.

- The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
- Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING),
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
- Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
- The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
- Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 

- Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

- Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ,
fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

- These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

### The whole dataset have 561 measurements and we extracted with the script run_analysis.R to extract measurements named
with mean or std,and have gotten following 79 variable and add subject and activity to get 81 varibles and 10299 observations

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
- mean(): Mean value
- std(): Standard deviation
- meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
- angle(): Angle between to vectors.


## The extracted variables are listed as follow.

1. subject:The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets. where 70% of the volunteers was selected for
           generating the training data and 30% the test data. with following group
           test group: subject no. 2   4   9  10  12  13  18  20  24
           train group: subject no. 1   3   5   6   7   8  11  14  15  16  17  19  21  22  23  25  26  27  28  29  30
2. activity:each subject has measure 6 activities-1 WALKING;2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS;3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS;4 SITTING;
           5 STANDING;6 LAYING
